+ASM1@db01 > kfod op=patches
+ASM2@db02 > kfod op=patches

+ASM1@db01 > kfod op=patchlvl 
+ASM2@db02 > kfod op=patchlvl 

Running rootcrs.pl again does not help
$GI_HOME/crs/install/rootcrs.pl -prepatch
$GI_HOME/crs/install/rootcrs.pl -postpatch
If patches reported by kfod op=patches are same on all nodes, try the following commands one at a time and check status
$GI_HOME/bin/clscfg -patch
$GI_HOME/bin/crsctl stop rollingpatch

crsctl query crs softwarepatch
